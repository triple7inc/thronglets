# Thronglets Simulation

A biologically-inspired AI simulation exploring emergent behavior in a virtual environment, inspired by *Black Mirror* Season 7, Episode 4: "Plaything" (2025). Creatures called **Thronglets** evolve, socialize, and adapt to environmental challenges like fire and rockfalls over hundreds of generations.

## 📦 Features

- **Dynamic Evolution:** Mutation-driven genetic evolution across generations
- **Social Relationships:** Thronglets form relationships, build groups, and develop social structures
- **Environmental Hazards:** Fire and rock events threaten survival
- **Grid-based Movement:** Real-time movement and interaction over a 2D grid
- **Emergent Behavior:** Watch intelligence and cooperation evolve under pressure
- **Data Logging:** JSON-based logs of all generations, including config snapshots
- **HTML Viewer:** View simulation history in an interactive HTML5 canvas

## 🧠 Algorithms and Mechanics

### Genetic Evolution
Each Thronglet has traits like `hp`, `speed`, `detection_range`, and `avoidance_speed`. Survivors pass their genes to offspring with a configurable `mutation_chance`.

### Relationship Dynamics
Thronglets detect nearby peers using `detection_range`. Repeated interaction strengthens or weakens relationship scores (0–10). Strong bonds lead to group formation.

### Group Formation
If a Thronglet has high scores (≥7) with neighbors, they form a **group**. Groups are tracked and visualized with IDs.

### Movement and Avoidance
Thronglets attempt to avoid recent "danger" areas—where other Thronglets died or where fire/rocks appeared.

### Environment Events
- **Fire Events:** Radius-based random events that reduce HP
- **Rock Events:** Radius-based impacts that instantly kill

## ⚙️ Configuration
Set simulation parameters in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "grid_width":100,
  "grid_height":100,
  "generations":200,
  "max_population":0,
  "population_size":200,
  "ticks_per_generation":30,
  "fire_event_chance":0.5,
  "rock_event_chance":0.2,
  "fire_event_radius":2,
  "rock_event_radius":1,
  "fire_event_max_damage":20,
  "mutation_chance":0.1,
  "logs_directory":"logs"
}
```

---

## 🕹️ Viewer
Run the simulation and open `viewer.html` in a browser. Load the `logs.zip` to visualize the simulation. Features include:

- Playback slider and animation
- Canvas-based cell grid
- Hover for Thronglet stats
- Fire/Rock visualization
- Group and relationship displays

---

## 🚀 Run the Simulation
Run from terminal:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

Zip logs are automatically created. Open them in the viewer.

## 📜 Log Output
Each generation is saved in `logs/` as `generation_X.json`. Other files include:

- `final_state.json`: End-of-sim snapshot
- `final_config.json`: Final config used
- `fires.json`, `rocks.json`: Event coordinates per generation

## 💡 Inspiration
"Thronglets" is a nod to *Black Mirror* S07E04 "Plaything" (2025), where emergent life simulations reveal unpredictable intelligence. We asked: what if evolution ran faster?
